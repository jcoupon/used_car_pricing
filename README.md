# What is my old car worth?

Following the extension of the family, we decided to buy a new, bigger, car, and hence to sell our old car (an Audi A3 sportsback). There exists online ressources to evaluate the price of used cars on the market (Eurotax for the swiss market) which I most probably use to fix a price (since that's the reference buyers watch), but I thought it was an interesting data science case to evaluate the price of my car based on the market, using web scraping and a bit of machine learning.

The adopted strategy consists into 3 steps:
- first acquire some data online including the price and the car characteristics
- build a pricing model using machine learning
- evaluate the price of my car given its characteristics
